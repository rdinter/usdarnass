An alternative for downloading various USDA data from
<https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/> through R. You must sign up for an
[API key](https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/api) from the mentioned
website in order for this package to work. Disclaimer:

> This product uses the NASS API but is not endorsed or certified by
> NASS.

# Install

Eventually, this package will be uploaded to
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) at which point you should be able to
install the package through the typical method:

``` r
install.packages("usdarnass")
```

However, until the package has been submitted to CRAN the only way to
use the package is through the development version (needs devtools
installed):

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rdinter/usdarnass")
```

Once installed through either method, you can load package the
conventional way:

``` r
library("usdarnass")
```

# Usage

See the [Get started](articles/usdarnass.html) article for a more in
depth discussion of the package features.
