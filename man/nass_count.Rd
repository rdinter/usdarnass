\usage{
nass_count(source_desc = NULL, sector_desc = NULL, group_desc = NULL,
  commodity_desc = NULL, short_desc = NULL, domain_desc = NULL,
  domaincat_desc = NULL, agg_level_desc = NULL,
  statisticcat_desc = NULL, state_name = NULL, asd_desc = NULL,
  county_name = NULL, region_desc = NULL, zip_5 = NULL,
  watershed_desc = NULL, year = NULL, freq_desc = NULL,
  reference_period_desc = NULL, token = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{source_desc}{"Program" - Source of data ("CENSUS" or "SURVEY"). Census
program includes the Census of Ag as well as follow up projects. Survey
program includes national, state, and county surveys.}

\item{sector_desc}{"Sector" - Five high level, broad categories useful to
narrow down choices. ("ANIMALS & PRODUCTS", "CROPS", "DEMOGRAPHICS",
"ECONOMICS", or "ENVIRONMENTAL")}

\item{group_desc}{"Group" - Subsets within sector (e.g., under sector_desc =
"CROPS", the groups are "FIELD CROPS", "FRUIT & TREE NUTS", "HORTICULTURE",
and "VEGETABLES").}

\item{commodity_desc}{"Commodity" - The primary subject of interest (e.g.,
"CORN", "CATTLE", "LABOR", "TRACTORS", "OPERATORS").}

\item{short_desc}{"Data Item" - A concatenation of six columns:
commodity_desc, class_desc, prodn_practice_desc, util_practice_desc,
statisticcat_desc, and unit_desc.}

\item{domain_desc}{"Domain" - Generally another characteristic of operations
that produce a particular commodity (e.g., "ECONOMIC CLASS", "AREA
OPERATED", "NAICS CLASSIFICATION", "SALES"). For chemical usage data, the
domain describes the type of chemical applied to the commodity. The
domain_desc = "TOTAL" will have no further breakouts; i.e., the data value
pertains completely to the short_desc.}

\item{domaincat_desc}{"Domain Category" - Categories or partitions within a
domain (e.g., under domain_desc = "SALES", domain categories include $1,000
TO $9,999, $10,000 TO $19,999, etc).}

\item{agg_level_desc}{"Geographic Level" - Aggregation level or geographic
granularity of the data. ("AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT", "COUNTY",
"INTERNATIONAL", "NATIONAL", "REGION : MULTI-STATE", "REGION : SUB-STATE",
"STATE", "WATERSHED", or "ZIP CODE")}

\item{statisticcat_desc}{"Category" - The aspect of a commodity being
measured (e.g., "AREA HARVESTED", "PRICE RECEIVED", "INVENTORY", "SALES").}

\item{state_name}{"State" - State full name.}

\item{asd_desc}{"Ag District" - Ag statistics district name.}

\item{county_name}{"County" - County name.}

\item{region_desc}{"Region" - NASS defined geographic entities not readily
defined by other standard geographic levels. A region can be a less than a
state (SUB-STATE) or a group of states (MULTI-STATE), and may be specific
to a commodity.}

\item{zip_5}{"Zip Code" - US Postal Service 5-digit zip code.}

\item{watershed_desc}{"Watershed" - Name assigned to the HUC.}

\item{year}{"Year" - The numeric year of the data and can be either a
character or numeric vector. Conditional values are also possible, for
example a character vector of ">=1999" of "1999<=" will give years greater
than or equal to 1999. Right now the logical values can either be
greater/less than or equal to with the logical at either the beginning or
end of a string with the year.}

\item{freq_desc}{"Period Type" - Length of time covered ("ANNUAL", "SEASON",
"MONTHLY", "WEEKLY", "POINT IN TIME"). "MONTHLY" often covers more than one
month. "POINT IN TIME" is as of a particular day.}

\item{reference_period_desc}{"Period" - The specific time frame, within a
freq_desc.}

\item{token}{API key, default is to use the value stored in \code{.Renviron}
which is stored from the \code{\link{set_nass_key}} function. If there is
no API key stored in the environment, a character string can be provided.}

\item{\\dots}{Not used.}

\value{
Number of observations.
}
\description{
Checks the number of observations that will be returned in a
  data request. All queries to the Quickstats are limited to 50,000
  observations. This is a helpful function in determining how to structure a
  data request to fit within the 50,000 limit.

# Find the number of observations for Wake County in North Carolina
